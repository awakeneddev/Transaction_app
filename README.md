# Transactions App with React

A simple blockchain transactions app built using React, Hardhat, and Ethereum smart contracts. This app allows users to make blockchain-based transactions by sending Ether to other addresses while interacting with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development framework for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts.
- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language to write the Ethereum contract.
- **Ethereum**: Blockchain platform to deploy and interact with smart contracts.
- **Alchemy**: API for interacting with Ethereum networks like Sepolia for test deployments.
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet for managing users' private keys and transactions.

## 🔧 Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 16.8 or higher
- **npm** or **Yarn**: For managing project dependencies
- **MetaMask**: Set up your MetaMask wallet for Ethereum transactions
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts
